# Chemotaxis-Simulation
Repository with the final code for Summer Research about the E. coli cells 


Simulated chemotactic motion of Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria in response to a nutrient gradient using Python and MATLAB with Dr. Hao Nguyen while working with Aaron Baker. As the nutrient diffuses, bacteria receive the chemical signals and process them through the intracellular signaling pathway.
We tested two separate models of the E. coli signaling network called SPECS and RapidCell; each outputs a probability to tell the bacterium to run or tumble.
We found out that SPECS cells trajectory were more rough due to higher tumbling frequency while RapidCell cells trajectory were more smooth due to higher running frequency.
Learned how to effectively communicate and give progress updates. Once a week we met with our PI to give updates on our code and regular communication through emails to address any difficulties along the way.
